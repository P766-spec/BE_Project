## Project Title: Automatic Facial Makeup Recognition
### Overview:
This machine learning project enhances security by detecting users trying to imitate someone else using makeup. If a fake user uploads an imitated image, the system triggers an alert..</br>

### Features:
1.Deep Neural Networks: Used to distinguish between real users and individuals attempting to imitate with makeup.</br>
2.Dataset: Contains over 1,000 images of makeup and non-makeup faces.</br>
3.Accuracy Improvement: Achieved a 20% reduction in recognition errors.</br>
4.UI: Developed a testing interface with Streamlit.</br>
5.Alert System for imitated images.</br>

### Usage:
1.Run the project locally.</br>
2.Upload images through the Streamlit interface.</br>
